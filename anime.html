            <p><img class="rimg" src="https://i1.wp.com/manga-home.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Kimetsu-no-Yaiba-poster.jpg"> The anime won the 2019 Newtype Anime Awards in the fields of "best TV anime", "best male character" (Tanjiro Kamado), "best female character" (Nezuko Kamado), "best theme song", "best director", "best character design", "best voice actor" (Natsuki Hanae), and "best voice actress" (Akari Kit≈ç).[61] In the February 2020 issue of Animedia magazine, it was revealed that the series received eleven awards for its characters at the "Animedia Character Awards 2019".[62] In February 2020, the series was awarded "Anime of the Year" at Crunchyroll Anime Awards, while Tanjiro won the "Best Boy" category and the fight of Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko versus Rui won the "Best Fight Scene" category.[63] In a poll conducted by Kadokawa Game Linkage of the most satisfying series of 2019, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba ranked in first place, and it was also reported that between its debut episode and last episode the viewership numbers increased by 1.4 million.[64][65]</p>
            <p>Writing for Monsters and Critics, Patrick Frye wrote that the anime adaptation is "praised [for] the animation quality and flowing battle scenes that integrate digital effects seamlessly" while noting that "some fans have complained about weird story pacing issues thanks to flashbacks and some slow moments, but everyone agrees that once the action picks up, it‚Äôs amazing."[66] Writing for Anime News Network, James Beckett highlighted Episode 19 by noting it was "a thrilling showstopper of an episode, showing off ufotable's considerable skills as producers of nearly unrivaled action spectacle."[67]</p>
            <p>The anime series has been considered one of the best anime of the 2010s by Polygon. Austen Goslin wrote that "Few shows over the last 10 years have so clearly or unabashedly made fights their focus, and absolutely none of them have done it as well as Demon Slayer".[68] Crunchyroll listed it in their "Top 25 best anime of the 2010s", with reviewer Daniel Dockery commenting, "From the top notch action choreography, to the understated (and sometimes not so understated) emotional moments, to the infinitely meme-able Inosuke, Demon Slayer can be a wonder to behold".[69][70] Writing for Comic Book Resources, Sage Ashford ranked it second on his list, praising its animation and protagonists, whom he called "the most likable male and female leads of the decade".[71] IGN also listed Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba among the best anime series of the 2010s.[72]</p>
